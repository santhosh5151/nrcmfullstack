<p>Welcome to the Mars 2020 Exploration Mission Guide, a special issue of RocketSTEM magazine. We are devoting the entire issue to informing you about the upcoming mission to the Red Planet, which will include the first-ever interplanetary helicopter. Whereas NASA’s traditional launch guide is targeted to journalists, our Mars Mission Guide is created specifically for the public at large with content for all ages. We’ve included an in-depth look at the Mars 2020 mission featuring the Perseverance rover and Ingenuity helicopter, as well as background on the Red Planet and past exploration missions. We’ve added our own fun twists with a photo gallery of the lead-up to the launch, a crossword puzzle, a word search, and two of our exclusive quizzes.

All that – and more – in the Mars 2020 Exploration Mission Guide.</p>
